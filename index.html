                <p class="description">
                    Since January 2024, my role as a Machine Learning Researcher at Tubaldi Lab, University of Maryland, has immersed me in cutting-edge research at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. One of my key projects involves the precise segmentation of the Aorta, employing advanced models such as V-NET, U-NET, SSL, and Uncertainty-informed Prototype Consistency Learning. This work is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnostics, and through rigorous development and testing, I achieved impressive accuracies of 95%, 94.75%, 93%, and 97% respectively. This project not only demonstrates my ability to navigate complex machine learning landscapes but also highlights my contribution to potentially life-saving medical research.
                    In addition to my work in medical imaging, I have also been instrumental in the development and optimization of an advanced 3D-printed robotic gripper for UR-3E robots. This innovative project leverages predictive capabilities to assess object pressure, volume, and dimensions, thereby enhancing the robot's handling efficiency and adaptability. Currently, under construction and training, this robotic gripper stands as a testament to my skills in marrying machine learning with practical robotics applications. The project embodies my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in robotics, aiming to create more intelligent, capable, and efficient robotic systems.

                    I undertook the development of intricate circuitry to support the functioning of an octagonal Static Thrust Test Pad and Flight Recovery System, specifically designed to meet the rigorous demands of high-powered rocketry applications. This endeavor required a meticulous approach to circuit design, ensuring that the systems could operate efficiently and reliably during testing and recovery processes.



In this project, I leveraged advanced tools such as Proteus and Raspberry Pi to implement a set of complex projects. One of the noteworthy achievements was enabling the Static Thrust Test Pad to accommodate the testing of up to eight rockets simultaneously. This not only demonstrated my technical expertise but also showcased my ability to adapt and innovate, addressing the specific requirements of rocketry testing.



Furthermore, a key aspect of this undertaking was prioritizing safety. I achieved this by designing and integrating a comprehensive Flight Recovery System. This system was intricately engineered to enhance safety measures during rocket testing and recovery operations. It not only served as a testament to my electronic circuit design skills but also highlighted my proficiency in seamlessly integrating various components into a cohesive and reliable system.


In summary, my involvement in the development of the circuitry for the Octagonal Static Thrust Test Pad and Flight Recovery System was marked by meticulous attention to detail, innovative problem-solving, and a steadfast commitment to safety, all of which significantly contributed to the success of these high-powered rocketry applications.
